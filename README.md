# NGSDataAnalysis
I have several scripts to download and process NSG datasets. It would be a good idea to share it with the world.

ATAC-Seq
--------
Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by Sequencing focus on the obtention of genomic regions that are not being wrapped by either nucleosomes or other cellular elements, meaning that they are "Accessible" for interaction with cellular elements.

Analysis  Overview:

0. (Optional) Download SRR.fastq.gz files
1. Quality check of the sequencing data
2. 2-step mapping
3. Contamination exploration
4. Cleaning
5. Sub-categories obtention
6. UCSC Genome Browser Tracks
7. Peak calling

ChIP-Seq
--------
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by Sequencing obtains genomic regions associated to a protein of interest.
